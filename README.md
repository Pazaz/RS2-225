# Refactoring and Expansion of the Revision 225 RS2 client

Original client release: May 18, 2004

Huge thanks to Dane for his work on the 186 and 317 clients:
- https://github.com/thedaneeffect/RuneScape-Beta-Public
- https://github.com/thedaneeffect/RuneScape-317

Without him this would have taken much, much longer.  
A little credit goes to Major for a few variable names as well.

## Status

- Every class has been given a name.
- Some classes have been refactored (~30% ish).
- No new features yet.

## Notes

I have a simpler history here, with no refactoring (just renaming classes), https://github.com/Pazaz/RS2-225/tree/deob  
This branch will hopefully make things easier for people to follow, and maybe someone can see how refactoring takes place.
